            <h2>Dear Agent,</h2>
            <p>We have an emergency. The secret formula for <strong>Atupcy Daily Essentials</strong>has been compromised. This formula is what makes our products unique, soft, and long-lasting.</p>
            <p>We suspect that <strong>Professor Puff</strong> is behind this. He has taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it's too late.</p>
            <p>Be sure to keep the lab's location <strong>confidential</strong>. Any leak of this information could jeopardize the entire operation.</p>
